# Kill-the-Political-Yard-Sings
(Console Game)
Specifications:

Setting up the game: The game board size can vary between 9 and 18 (square form). The number of elements in the board is limited depending on the size of the board. Number of PYS stupid and smart are limited to 1/8 of the area of the board, the houses to 1/6 of the area. The hardcore mode limited the vision of the player to 3 spaces around. 

Controls: The movement of the player is using the key board with the system of WASX and the diagonals with QEZC. Attacks are made with OP, O for SCS  and P for flamethrower.

The logic: Houses can block the attacks and can be pass over. No attack can be use against an enemy if there is a house in the way. Stuns can't be stacked, if an element is stunned, another stun will not have effect on it. Attacks with a range of spaces two will not affect an enemy in a range of one, Ex: if a PYS is next to the human, the flamethrower attack cannot be performed (Using the flamethrower so close can burns the player :) )
